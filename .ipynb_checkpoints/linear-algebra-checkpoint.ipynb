    "## Scalars, Vectors, Matrics and Tensors\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Scalars** - A scalar is just a single number.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Vectors** - A vector is an array of numbers. Number in \n",
    "array identified using its index in the ordering. We can think \n",
    "of vectors as identifying points in space, each element in the\n",
    "vector giving the coordinates along a different axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Matrices** - A matrix is a 2-D array of numbers, so each\n",
    "element is identified by two indices instead of just one.\n",
    "**_A<sub>i, :</sub>_** represents a row of the matrix. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Tensors** - An array fo numbers on a regular gird with a\n",
    "variable number of axes is known as a tensor.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Matrix operations\n",
    "\n",
    "Transpose of a matrix is the mirror image of the matrix across a\n",
    "diagonal line called the main diagonal. Starting from the upper-left\n",
    "corner and going down and to the right. It essentially puts the\n",
    "element at position *(i, j)* of a matrix to be at position\n",
    "*(j, i)* of the transpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "**_C_** = **_A_** + **_B_** corresponds to the addition of two\n",
    "matrices. This is only possible as long as the two matrices have\n",
    "the same shape. This operation corresponds to adding elements\n",
    "at position *(i, j)* of A and B and assigning their sum to the\n",
    "*(i, j)* element of C. \n",
    "\n",
    "Adding or multiplying a scalar to a matrix corresponds to performing\n",
    "the operation on every element of the matrix. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Broadcasting is a less conventional notation used in deep learning\n",
    "wherein we allow the addition of a matrix to a vector yielding another\n",
    "matrix. Here this operation corresponds to C<sub>i, j</sub> = A<sub>i, \n",
    "j</sub> + b<sub>j</sub>. Vector b gets added to each row of the matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "Matrix multiplication - the produce of matrices A and B is C. In order\n",
    "for this product ot be defined A must have the same number of columns\n",
    "as B has rows. If A is of shape $m \\times n $ and B is of shape \n",
    "$n \\times p$ then C will be of shape $m \\times p$. The notation for\n",
    "matrix product is simply **_C = AB _** where the product operation\n",
    "is defined by $C_{i, j} = \\sum_{k} A_{i, k} B_{k, j} $.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Hadamard product is denoted by A âŠ™ B and is the element-wise product\n",
    "of two matrices. The dot product between two vectors x and y of the same\n",
    "dimensionality is the matrix product $x^{T}y$. We can think of the matrix\n",
    "product C = AB as computing $C_{i, j}$ the dot product between row i of A\n",
    "and column j of B.\n",
    "\n",
    "Matrix products have the following mathematical properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Distributive\n",
    "* Associative\n",
    "\n",
    "Matrix multiplication is not commutative but the dot product between two\n",
    "vectors is commutative.\n",
    "\n",
    "$(AB)^{T} = B^{T}A$\n",
    "\n",
    "$Ax = B$\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve this system of linear equations Linear Algebra provides us with the\n",
    "matrix inversion operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The identity matrix is a matrix that does not change any vector when we multiply\n",
    "that vector by that matrix. We denote the idenity matrix that preserves n-dimensional\n",
    "vectors as $I_{n}$j. The identity matrix has all the entries along the main diagonal\n",
    "as 1 (with the rest of the entries being 0).\n",
    "\n",
    "The __matrix inverse__ of A is denoted as $A^{-1}$ and it is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ A^{-1} A = I_{n} $\n",
    "\n",
    "which gives us x = $A^{-1}b $\n",
    "\n",
    "For $A^{-1}$ to exist equation 2.11 must have exactyl one solution for every value of\n",
    "b. It is also possible for the system of equations to have no solutions or infinitely\n",
    "many solutions. Since if x and y are solutions for a particular b then\n",
    "\n",
    "$ z = \\alpha x + (1 - \\alpha) y $\n",
    "\n",
    "is also a solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The span of a set of vectors is the set of all points obtainable by linear combination of\n",
    "all the original vectors. Testing whether Ax = b comes down to checking whether b is in\n",
    "the span of the columns of A. This particular span is known as the column space, or the\n",
    "range of A. To be able to cover $R^{m}$ we need at least m vectors in A. This is a necessary\n",
    "condition but not a sufficient one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear Dependence will cause us to need more vectors. In geenral a set of vectors is\n",
    "said to be linearly independent if no vector in the set is a linear combination of \n",
    "the  other vectors. This guarantees that there is at least one solution for every b\n",
    "that belongs to $R^{m}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "But to have an inverse a matrix must have at most one solution for each value of b.\n",
    "To do this we must make sure that that the matrix must have at most m columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that a matrix needs to be square and the columns need to be linearly\n",
    "independent for an inverse to  \n",
