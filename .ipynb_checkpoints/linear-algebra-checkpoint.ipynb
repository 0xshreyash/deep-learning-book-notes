    "#### Linear Algebra\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter covers the basics of linear algebra that are needed are for deep learning. It is not meant to be an exhausitve resource for linear algebra but teaches the reader enough to use linear algebra in the context of deep learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scalars, Vectors, Matrics and Tensors\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Scalars** - A scalar is just a single number that can take up many different values.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Vectors** - A vector is an array of numbers. An elemennt in the\n",
    "array identified using its index in the ordering. We can think \n",
    "of vectors as identifying points in space, each element in the\n",
    "vector giving the coordinates along a different axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Matrices** - A matrix is a 2-D array of numbers, so each\n",
    "element is identified by two indices instead of just one.\n",
    "_A_ represents a row of the matrix. `\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Tensors** - An array fo numbers on a regular gird with a\n",
    "variable number of axes is known as a tensor. A tensor with n axes\n",
    "can be thought of as an n-dimensional array. Matrices and vectors\n",
    "are just tensors with their 2 and 1 axes respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Matrix operations\n",
    "\n",
    "__Transpose__ - of a matrix is the mirror image of the matrix across a\n",
    "diagonal line called the _main diagonal_, Starting from the upper-left\n",
    "corner and going down and to the right. It essentially puts the\n",
    "element at position *(i, j)* of a matrix to position\n",
    "*(j, i)* of the transpose. Note: the transpose of the transpose of a\n",
    "matrix is the matrix itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Addition__ of two matrices, _A + B_ corresponds to the addition of two\n",
    "matrices. This is only possible as long as the two matrices have\n",
    "the same shape. This operation corresponds to adding elements\n",
    "at position *(i, j)* of _A and B_ and assigning their sum to the\n",
    "*(i, j)*-th element of the resultant matrix, let's say _C_.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Adding or multiplying a scalar__ to a matrix corresponds to performing\n",
    "the addition/multiplication of the scalar to each element of the matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Broadcasting__ is a less conventional notation used in deep learning\n",
    "wherein we allow the addition of a matrix to a vector yielding another\n",
    "matrix. Lets say we perform $C = A + b$ where b is a column vector (a\n",
    "vector with just one column). This corresponds to adding to each element\n",
    "in $A_{i, :}$ the value at $b_{i}$. In a similar vain, if we were to\n",
    "add a row vector to $A$ we would result in the addition of $b_{j}$\n",
    "to every column $j$ of A.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Matrix multiplication__ - the product of matrices A and B resulting in a matrix C.\n",
    "In order for this product to be defined $A$ must have the same number of columns\n",
    "as $B$ has rows. If $A$ is of shape $m \\times n$ and $B$ is of shape \n",
    "$n \\times p$ then $C$ will be of shape $m \\times p$. The notation for\n",
    "matrix product is simply $C = AB$ where the product operation\n",
    "is defined by $C_{i, j} = \\sum_{k} A_{i, k} B_{k, j} $.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Hadamard product__ is denoted by A âŠ™ B and is the element-wise product\n",
    "of two matrices. This corresponds to multiplying element _i, j_ of $A$ with\n",
    "element _i, j_ of $B$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The __dot product__ between two vectors $x$ and $y$ of the same\n",
    "dimensionality is the matrix product $x^{T}y$. We can think of the matrix\n",
    "product $C = AB$ as computing $C_{i, j}$ the dot product between row i of A\n",
    "and column j of B.\n",
    "\n",
    "Matrix products have the following mathematical properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Distributive\n",
    "* Associative\n",
    "\n",
    "Matrix multiplication is not commutative but the dot product between two\n",
    "vectors is commutative.\n",
    "\n",
    "$(AB)^{T} = B^{T}A$\n",
    "\n",
    "$Ax = B$\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve this system of linear equations Linear Algebra provides us with the\n",
    "matrix inversion operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The identity matrix is a matrix that does not change any vector when we multiply\n",
    "that vector by that matrix. We denote the idenity matrix that preserves n-dimensional\n",
    "vectors as $I_{n}$j. The identity matrix has all the entries along the main diagonal\n",
    "as 1 (with the rest of the entries being 0).\n",
    "\n",
    "The __matrix inverse__ of A is denoted as $A^{-1}$ and it is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ A^{-1} A = I_{n} $\n",
    "\n",
    "which gives us x = $A^{-1}b $\n",
    "\n",
    "For $A^{-1}$ to exist equation 2.11 must have exactyl one solution for every value of\n",
    "b. It is also possible for the system of equations to have no solutions or infinitely\n",
    "many solutions. Since if x and y are solutions for a particular b then\n",
    "\n",
    "$ z = \\alpha x + (1 - \\alpha) y $\n",
    "\n",
    "is also a solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The span of a set of vectors is the set of all points obtainable by linear combination of\n",
    "all the original vectors. Testing whether Ax = b comes down to checking whether b is in\n",
    "the span of the columns of A. This particular span is known as the column space, or the\n",
    "range of A. To be able to cover $R^{m}$ we need at least m vectors in A. This is a necessary\n",
    "condition but not a sufficient one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear Dependence will cause us to need more vectors. In geenral a set of vectors is\n",
    "said to be linearly independent if no vector in the set is a linear combination of \n",
    "the  other vectors. This guarantees that there is at least one solution for every b\n",
    "that belongs to $R^{m}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "But to have an inverse a matrix must have at most one solution for each value of b.\n",
    "To do this we must make sure that that the matrix must have at most m columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that a matrix needs to be square and the columns need to be linearly\n",
    "independent for an inverse to  \n",
